                        <p class="primary-text"><strong>Software Development Intern - MEDO.ai</strong><br>I worked on an application used by clinicians for annotating multi-frame ultrasound images. 
                            I got hands-on experience with vanilla TypeScript, HTML, and CSS on the front-end; C# on the backend.</p>

                            <br>For my CMPUT 401 project in Winter 2020, I worked on Full-stack educational web application 
                            in a team using React and Django. The project was proposed by Dr. Ken Wong at the University of 
                            Alberta, with the goal of helping computer science/engineering students practice software engineering principles taught in class.</p>

                            I have become very comfortable using it. I enjoyed using python in my first natural language processing course
                            (CMPUT 497), and I'm interested in exploring that area further in the future.</p>
